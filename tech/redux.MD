The state of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single store. That is, there are not multiple stores keeping chunks of the entire state of the web application. Having a single a single store also helps in debugging the app.

Actions are plain JavaScript object that describes what happened. They can be thought of as the "intent" to do something. Here are a few example actions:

```js
{ type: 'ADD_TODO', text: 'Go to swimming pool' }
{ type: 'TOGGLE_TODO', index: 1 }
{ type: 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER', filter: 'SHOW_ALL' }
```

### 3. Can functions be an action? :star:

Yes. Libraries like `redux-thunk` allows developers to use functions as actions.

See [redux-thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk)

### 4. What are reducers in Redux? :star:

Reducers are just pure functions that take the previous state and an action, and return the next state. Example:

```js
function handleAuth(state, action) {
    return {
        ...state,
        auth: action.payload
    });
}
```

</details>

### 5. What is `Store` in Redux? :star:

<details>

        Answer
    </summary>

Store is the object that holds the application state. It provides a few helper methods to access the state, dispatch actions and register listeners. The entire store is kept in a single JavaScript object.

Reducers are used to get a new state from an existing state. The new state becomes the store.

### 9. What are middlewares in Redux?. :star:

<details>
    <summary>
        Answer
    </summary>

`Middleware` generally refers to software services that "glue together" separate features in existing software. For Redux, middleware provides a third-party extension point between dispatching an action and handing the action off to the reducer:

[ Action ] <-> [ Middleware ] <-> [ Dispatcher ]

Examples of middleware include logging, crash reporting, routing, handling asynchronous requests, etc.

Middleware is basically a function that accepts the store, which is expected to return a function that accepts the next function, which is expected to return a function which accepts an action.

Here is an example of logging Middleware:

```js
const loggingMiddleware = store => next => action => {
  // Our middleware
  console.log(`Redux Log:`, action);
  // call the next function
  next(action);
};
```
